# odin-recipes
My recipe page
This is me altering the README page. The project is in odin-recipes. It should be in a bigger directory the_odin_project. But I set taht up too late. I need to find a way to put the odin-recipes into the_odin_project. I also need to think about staging and commiting to git.
